# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to Meshtastic Apple! Please read this guide before opening a PR.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode (latest stable)
- iOS/macOS simulators installed
- SwiftLint (`brew install swiftlint`)

Run `./scripts/setup-hooks.sh` once after cloning to install the pre-commit SwiftLint hook.

### Signing with your own team

Every target takes its team, bundle IDs, app group and app entitlements from `Config/Signing.xcconfig`. To sign with your own team, copy `Config/Local.xcconfig.example` to `Config/Local.xcconfig` and edit it. `Local.xcconfig` is git-ignored, so your team never ends up in a commit, and you don't need to change the team in Xcode.

```
MESHTASTIC_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = ABCDE12345
MESHTASTIC_BUNDLE_ID_PREFIX = com.example.MeshtasticClient
MESHTASTIC_APP_GROUP = group.com.example.MeshtasticClient
```

Bundle IDs and the app group belong to the team that registered them, so pick a prefix of your own. Close and reopen the project after creating or changing `Local.xcconfig`.

#### Free personal teams

A free personal team can't use several of the app's capabilities: Siri, CarPlay, WeatherKit, NFC tag reading, associated domains, communication notifications and critical alerts. Add two more lines to `Local.xcconfig`:

```
MESHTASTIC_APP_ENTITLEMENTS = Meshtastic/Meshtastic-PersonalTeam.entitlements
MESHTASTIC_SWIFT_CONDITIONS = NO_SIRI
```

The first signs the app with only the app group and keychain sharing. The second builds the app without its Siri requests and leaves the Siri step out of onboarding. Without it, `INPreferences.requestSiriAuthorization` crashes the app when the Siri entitlement is missing. The other features fail quietly: no weather, no NFC, no CarPlay, no meshtastic.org links opening the app. Apps signed with a free team stop launching after 7 days until you build them again.

#### The simulator

The simulator doesn't need a team. Sign to run locally: in Xcode, set the Meshtastic target's Team to None and Signing Certificate to Sign to Run Locally. From the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -workspace Meshtastic.xcworkspace -scheme Meshtastic \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual DEVELOPMENT_TEAM= PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER= \
  build
```

Building with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` leaves out every entitlement, including Siri, so the app crashes on the Siri step of onboarding. Add `MESHTASTIC_SWIFT_CONDITIONS=NO_SIRI` to the command to avoid that.

## Documentation

The app ships a built-in Help & Documentation browser, a Jekyll site on GitHub Pages, and documentation is also published to the main [meshtastic.org](https://meshtastic.org) site.

| Resource | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Meshtastic.org | [meshtastic.org/docs/category/apple-apps](https://meshtastic.org/docs/category/apple-apps/) |
| GitHub Pages | [meshtastic.github.io/Meshtastic-Apple](https://meshtastic.github.io/Meshtastic-Apple/) |

| Deep link | [`meshtastic:///settings/helpDocs`](meshtastic:///settings/helpDocs) |

Source markdown lives under `docs/user/` and `docs/developer/`. To rebuild the bundled HTML after editing any markdown:

```sh
bash scripts/build-docs.sh --output Meshtastic/Resources/docs
```

Commit the regenerated files under `Meshtastic/Resources/docs/` with your PR.

## Branch Naming

Branch from `main` (trunk-based development). Use descriptive names:

```
feat/bluetooth-reconnect-improvements
fix/crash-on-ble-disconnect
docs/update-mqtt-guide
chore/update-protobufs
```

## Commit Messages

Use imperative mood subject lines:

```
Fix crash when BLE device disconnects
Add TAK CoT position relay support
Update protobufs to v2.7
```

Explain *what* changed and *why* in the body. Keep subject lines under 72 characters.

## PR Checklist

- [ ] All existing tests pass (`⌘U` in Xcode)
- [ ] New tests written for new features and bug fixes
- [ ] SwiftLint reports no new errors or warnings
- [ ] UI changes include screenshots or a screen recording in the PR description
- [ ] Deep link additions are documented in `docs/developer/deep-links.md`
- [ ] SwiftData schema changes include a `VersionedSchema` and `MigrationStage`
- [ ] Protobuf changes are regenerated with `./scripts/gen_protos.sh` and built

## Code Style

- **Swift only.** No Objective-C.
- **SwiftUI** for all UI. UIKit only where unavoidable.
- **SF Symbols** for all icons — no embedded image assets for icons.
- **OSLog** for all logging — no `print()`. SwiftLint enforces this.
- Indent with **tabs**.
- Opening braces on the same line.
- `// MARK: -` to separate logical sections.
- `guard` for early exit; avoid deeply nested `if`.

## SwiftLint Limits

| Check | Warning | Error |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Line length | 400 | — |
| File length | 3500 | — |
| Type body length | 400 | — |
| Function body length | 200 | — |
| Cyclomatic complexity | 60 | — |
| Type name length | 60 | 70 |

## Platform Guards

- Guard iOS-only APIs: `#if !targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)`
- Guard canImport: `#if canImport(UIKit)`
- Guard version availability: `if #available(iOS 26, *) { ... }`

## Updating Protobufs

`./scripts/gen_protos.sh` bumps the `protobufs/` submodule and regenerates
`MeshtasticProtobufs/Sources/` in one step — no separate `git submodule update`:

```sh
./scripts/gen_protos.sh             # pull protobufs origin/master, then regenerate
./scripts/gen_protos.sh develop     # pull a different branch, tag or commit
./scripts/gen_protos.sh --no-pull   # regenerate against the currently pinned protos
```

Only `protoc` needs to be installed (`brew install protobuf`). The script builds
`protoc-gen-swift` itself, from the swift-protobuf version pinned in
`MeshtasticProtobufs/Package.resolved` — **never** generate with a Homebrew
`protoc-gen-swift`. Brew's plugin drifts older than what the project links and
silently downgrades every generated file, dropping `Sendable`,
`Swift.CaseIterable`/`allCases` and the `// swiftlint:disable all` header, which
removes concurrency conformance and makes SwiftLint lint generated code.

After regenerating:

1. Build and verify tests pass.
2. Mirror any new proto enum cases into the app-side enums that shadow them —
   `FirmwareEditions`, `RegionCodes`, and friends map by raw value, so an
   unmapped case silently falls back to a default instead of failing to compile.
3. Commit the generated changes together with the submodule pointer update.

## Release Process

See `RELEASING.md` in the repository root for the full release checklist and App Store submission process.
