## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Meshtastic-Apple.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Meshtastic-Apple
   ```
4. Open the Meshtastic.xcworkspace
   ```sh
   open Meshtastic.xcworkspace
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Targeting `main`

In accordance with trunk-based development, all changes should target the `main` branch.

### Small, Incremental Changes

To facilitate easy code reviews and minimize merge conflicts, we encourage making small, incremental changes. Each change should be a self-contained, logically coherent unit of work that addresses a specific task or fixes a particular issue.

### Rebase Commits

To keep the project history clean, please use rebasing over merging when incorporating changes from the `main` branch into your feature branches. To rebase your branch on `main`, you can perform the following steps.

```sh
git fetch
git rebase main
```

To enable pulls to rebase by default, you can use this git configuration option.

```sh
git config pull.rebase true
```

## Creating a Branch

1. Always create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name for your branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

## Making Changes

1. Make your changes in the new branch.
2. Ensure your changes adhere to the projectâ€™s coding standards and conventions.
3. Keep your changes focused and avoid combining multiple unrelated tasks in a single branch.

## Commit Messages

1. Write clear and concise commit messages following the guidelines in [Git Commit Messages](#git-commit-messages).

## Merging Changes

1. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```sh
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
2. Create a pull request (PR) targeting the `main` branch.
3. Ensure your PR adheres to the project's guidelines and includes a clear description of the changes.
4. Request a code review from the project maintainers.

## Testing

1. Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting your PR.
2. Write new tests for any new features or bug fixes.
3. Run the tests locally

## Code Review

1. Address any feedback or changes requested by the reviewers.
2. Once approved, the PR will be merged into the `main` branch by a project maintainer.

## Documentation

1. Update the documentation to reflect any changes you have made.
2. Ensure the documentation is clear and concise.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
- Use the body to explain what and why, not how.

### Code Style

- This project requires swiftLint - see https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint
- Use SwiftUI
- Use SFSymbols for icons
- Use Core Data for persistence
- Ensure your code is clean and well-documented.

## Community

- Join our community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ktMAKGBnBs).
- Participate in discussions and share your ideas.
