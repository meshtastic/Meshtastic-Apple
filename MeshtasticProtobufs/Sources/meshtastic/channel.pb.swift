/// This information can be encoded as a QRcode/url so that other users can configure

/// A note about how channel names are shown to users: channelname-X
/// poundsymbol is a prefix used to indicate this is a channel name (idea from @professr).
/// Where X is a letter from A-Z (base 26) representing a hash of the PSK for this
/// channel - so that if the user changes anything about the channel (which does
/// force a new PSK) this letter will also change. Thus preventing user confusion if
/// two friends try to type in a channel name of "BobsChan" and then can't talk
/// because their PSKs will be different.
/// The PSK is hashed into this letter by "0x41 + [xor all bytes of the psk ] modulo 26"
/// This also allows the option of someday if people have the PSK off (zero), the
/// users COULD type in a channel name and be able to talk.
